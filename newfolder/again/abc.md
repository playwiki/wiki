# ABC Corp

e venues when he was just releasing “Rhythm of the Saints.” He came in before the show, listened to the playback (which was not to his liking) and had a total meltdown tantrum like a small child. He yelled and screamed and stomped around. People were cringing and running for cover.

He could have handled the situation in “fifty different ways” and gotten better action from the crew. His disregard for humans other than himself showed greatly. He came off as a total jerk.

I had always enjoyed his music have great respect for his talent and painstakingly detailed work on lyrics and melody, but my opinion of the man went way down that day.

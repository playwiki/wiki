GitHub's mascot is an anthropomorphized "octocat" with five octopus-like arms.[41][42] The character was created by graphic designer Simon Oxley as clip art to sell on iStock,[43] a website that enables designers to market royalty-free digital images.

GitHub became interested in Oxley's work after Twitter selected a bird that he designed for their own logo.[44] The illustration GitHub chose was a character that Oxley had named Octopuss.[43] Since GitHub wanted Octopuss for their logo (a use that the iStock license disallows), they negotiated with Oxley to buy exclusive rights to the image.[43]

GitHub renamed Octopuss to Octocat,[43] and trademarked the character along with the new name.[41] Later, GitHub hired illustrator Cameron McEfee to adapt Octocat for different purposes on the website and promotional materials; McEfee and various GitHub users have since created hundreds of variations of the character.[45][46]
